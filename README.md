To navigate the main page, the initial display showcases the first 10 characters. From here, users can explore the following options within the page:

🔍**Search:** Conduct searches based on character names. The search utilizes the 'swapi.dev' API, and the page number adjusts dynamically based on search results.

🏽**Filtering:** Apply filters to narrow down results based on gender and homeworld. It's important to note that filtering is limited to the current page to optimize API calls.

🔢**Pagination:** Navigate between pages to view additional characters. Each page switch triggers a new API call.

These features collectively provide a user-friendly experience for exploring and discovering Star Wars characters through the SWAPI People Gallery.
